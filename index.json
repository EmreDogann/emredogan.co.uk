Keep your guests, the four horsemen of the apocalypse, happy by fulfilling all their demands before the timer runs out and Azathoth awakens.\nContributions # For this game, I was tasked with implementing the main game mechanics:\nUI Interaction \u0026amp; Controls Audio Playback AI Event Scripting Tutorial Win/Lose State I also helped develop other mechanics such as:\nDialogue System Guests # The gameplay loop focuses on constantly pressuring the player by overwhelming them with guest demands/needs. Guests can make different requests, which the player must fulfill in order to keep them happy.\nFor the guest AI, I took inspiration from Needs-Based AIs implemented in games such as The Sims. Each guest has a set of metrics (such as hunger and thirst) that continually tick down and can also be influenced by external events occurring in the game world (e.g. power outage).\nRequests can only be fulfilled by the player completing a set of actions. Instead of hardcoding these actions, I implemented a simple Action List. These action lists are integrated into the editor via a custom editor script, allowing for designers on the team to create new actions lists on the fly using predetermined building blocks.\nAction List for Drink Refills. UI # I created a UI system that allowed us to quickly spin-up UI views and link them together to create pause menus but was also used for the dialogue system\u0026rsquo;s UI to great success. The system works similar to layers in a photo manipulation software, with it keeping track of a stack of UI views it can navigate. Views have hooks for when they are popped and pushed from the stack, allowing for functionality such as transition animations.\nEvent Scripting # This was a difficult part of the project. Once we made an MVP, we quickly realized that the mechanics were too convoluted and therefore people had trouble figuring out what to do. We tackled this by stripping out a lot of mechanics and simplifying the gameplay loop to make it easier to digest. Along with that, we also decided to create a tutorial for the game to help ease players in.\nI went back and forth with the game designers a lot to decide the best ways the convey information to the player without making the tutorial too hand-holdy, as was a worry the rest of the team had from their past game jams.\nAll the tutorial scripting was done using Unity\u0026rsquo;s timeline system \u0026amp; API. Custom playables were created to facilitate the experimentation of the tutorial. Such playables included:\nControlling sprite sorting order. Controlling interactable object states. Controlling AI. Integration into the project\u0026rsquo;s dialogue system developed by fellow programmers. Text popup with animation and audio. The tutorial timeline sequence.

With a background primarily rooted in Unity, it was very interesting to see how the two engines differed with regards to philosophies and opinions about workflow and development. One aspect that particularly stood out to me was Godot\u0026rsquo;s embrace of a web-inspired approach to UI, which significantly streamlined the UI development process compared to Unity\u0026rsquo;s immediate-mode GUI.\nWhile we appreciated GDScript for its Python-like syntax, we encountered limitations in its flexibility when attempting to create a mini filesystem for the project. Fortunately, Godot\u0026rsquo;s support for mono allowed us to integrate a more traditional programming language, C#, for this purpose.\nContributions # For this game, I worked on:\nUI Level Progression Interaction Audio Win/Lose State Visual Effects Audio # A significant aspect of this game was to immerse players in the experience of using a computer. To achieve this goal, we meticulously replicated details like mouse clicks and keyboard presses, while also fine-tuning the audio to recreate a more expansive sound environment.\nUI # UI was another aspect we paid close attention to. We wanted to harken back to the days of Windows XP where you would find viruses on browser bars, little mascots dancing in the corner of your screen, and more malicious variants. Using many references available online, I was able to closely emulate both the visuals of the OS as well as the experience of using it.\nIn the end I ended up writing a small window manager that allows for the movement, opening and closing of windows to facilitate windows popping up to block the player\u0026rsquo;s mouse clicks, like what would have been done by viruses in that era.\nThe UI was then integrated with the mini file system that was written by my teammate to create the file explorer window in the game.\n","date":"22 September 2023","permalink":"/projects/clown-panic/","section":"","summary":"Puzzle Horror game for\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGo Godot 3 Game Jam\u003c/strong\u003e","title":"Clown Panic"},{"content":"","date":"22 September 2023","permalink":"/projects/","section":"","summary":"","title":""},{"content":"","date":"22 September 2023","permalink":"/tags/c++/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"C++"},{"content":"","date":"22 September 2023","permalink":"/tags/graphics/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Graphics"},{"content":"","date":"22 September 2023","permalink":"/tags/opengl/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"OpenGL"},{"content":"","date":"22 September 2023","permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":"22 September 2023","permalink":"/tags/university/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"University"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m a Game Developer that enjoys all facets of development,\nprimarily focusing on graphics engineering and games programming.\nI have experience working at the higher-level with VFX/Shader development to lower-level work with graphics APIs such as OpenGL \u0026amp; Vulkan.\nI started off my game development journey in Unity and have since also used other engines such as Godot and more bespoke C++ engines during the course of my university degree.
