[{"content":"\nOverview # For my final university project, I decided to create a simple Vulkan renderer from scratch using C++. This was coming off of the OpenGL work I had done in Space Rider for my Computer Graphics university module.\nFeatures # Hybrid Renderer (Rasterization + Ray traced features such as Shadows, Reflections and Refractions) UI through ImGUI Mouse Picking Scene Manipulation via ImGuizmo My main motivation for this project was to experiment with hardware ray-tracing. Along the way, I was exposed to the many challenges such as: how to effectively architect a graphics renderer to minimize technical debt and scope, management of memory resources, and CPU-GPU synchronization.\nFor the initial version, due to time constraints from this project\u0026rsquo;s report write-up as part of the University\u0026rsquo;s final project module (as well as other university courses I was taking at the time), many of the features were not in a place I was happy with and as a result could do with some improvement.\nWhile I was not a complete stranger to graphics programming when starting development of this project, I underestimated the jump in complexity going from OpenGL to Vulkan would be. Many concepts in Vulkan took a while to wrap my head around and so rewrites of parts of the renderer were common. However, looking back in retrospect, it was an important part of my journey in graphics programming as it gave me a view into just far the rabbit hole could go (and even further beyond). Needless to say, the experience gained from this project only further cemented my love for graphics programming.\nThis was also my first time trying to build a C++ application from scratch, instead of being given a starting point to work off of. This meant understanding build toolchains and tools such as CMake to streamline this process.\nCurrently, I am in the process of re-writing this renderer, taking the lessons I learnt and the hardships I faced from the initial attempt into consideration.\n","date":"15 September 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/personal/vulkan-renderer/","section":"","summary":"Hybrid graphics renderer made using Vulkan \u0026amp; C++","title":"Vulkan Renderer","type":"projects/personal"},{"content":"","date":"15 September 2023","externalUrl":"https://github.com/EmreDogann/Software-Ray-Tracer","permalink":"/projects/personal/software-ray-tracing/","section":"","summary":"A simple offline software ray tracer made in C++","title":"Software Ray Tracer","type":"projects/personal"},{"content":"\nOverview # Space Rider is racing game made for the purpose of my Computer Graphics university module.\nThe purpose of this project was to explore different graphics ideas and techniques in OpenGL, commonly used in real-time rendering. The subjects explored in this project were as follows:\nShadow Mapping (Omni-directional/Point shadows) Multi-texturing (albedo, roughness, emissive maps) Environmental Mapping (Cubemap reflections) Instanced Rendering Bloom Vertex Displacement Animations This project was my second time using OpenGL, this time the project was focused more on working with OpenGL to achieve certain effects all in the context of building out a simple racing game. We were given a base to start from, mainly Window creation via Win32 API, font rendering via FreeType, and .obj model imports via assimp.\nBloom # One effect of note if the Bloom implementation. At first, the implementation mirrored the one listed out in LearnOpenGL. However, I was unhappy with the end result, leading to something that felt very unnatural. As I was going for a retrowave aestheic, with lots of bright neon lights, this meant a lot of the image would consist of some form of bloom and especially for big light emitters in the scene (such as the Sun), the bloom effect was not very convincing.\nSo, I did a little bit of research and came across this bloom implementation by Jorge Jimenez at SIGGRAPH 2014. In the end, after some tweaking of bloom values, the effect was much closer to what I had envisioned.\nThat is not to say I did not run into issues along the way. For example, rounding errors of image resolutions during downscaling/upscaling of the bloom image lead to an offset accumulated final bloom image.\nFinal Bloom image before composition \u0026amp; tone mapping. Finding the issue of rounding errors took some time, as I was still new to graphics development at the time, I was trying more traditional debugging techniques to solve the issue. After being unsuccessful on that front, I found out about graphics debuggers such as RenderDoc. Using this, I was very quickly able to find the issue and resolve the rounding errors in the code.\nFixed bloom image.

With this being one of the first times working on a game with artists/audio designers, I learned a lot in terms of how to communicate with teammates coming from different professions with vastly different vocabulary. When communication was troublesome at times, we found that creating a quick prototype to show instead of tell, was the most effective.\nContributions # For this game, I worked on:\nInteraction system (Doors, items) Audio Soundscape Visual Effects (Shooting, camera sway) 1-Bit Graphical Effect 1-Bit limitation # The 1-Bit restriction posed many interesting problems during development that we had not expected. For example, we used a UI fade-to-black overlay to hide the transition between rooms. However, we later realized this violated the 1-Bit challenge as the black overlay would additively combine with colors in the level to create an image that was no longer 1-bit.\nAs a result, we had to redesign that system from a UI-based fade to black, to one that was more tightly integrated into the level. We tried many solutions but in the end settled for dimming all the lights in the level to black, then returning them back to their original intensity once the level transition was finished. This solution granted us the ability to control all the lights in a room, allowing us to also play with light intensities for specific scripted sequences.\n1-Bit Dither # We decided early on that we wanted to base the game inside a submarine. We also agreed on a more atmospheric horror experience. These requirements meant that we had to focus on making the submarine levels feel lived in and immersive. At that time we were using a simple thresholding shader to achieve our 1-bit look, as the team was building out the art assets and designing the levels, we found that we were unable to reach a high enough level of detail and density in the level due to the harsh cutoffs from the thresholding effect making it difficult to discern details in and around objects.\nI spent some time researching how other games with similar 1-bit restrictions overcame these problems. I quickly came across Return of the Obra Dinn (RotOD) and was immediately hooked. Luckily, Lucas Pope, the creator of RotOD, posted a very extensive write-up on the theory behind the effect.\nFollowing in his footsteps, I managed to create a close enough approximation, but quickly ran into swimming artifacts as I was unable to fully recreate the spherical projection mapping he employed for RotOD.\nYour browser doesn't support embedded videos, but don't worry, you can download it and watch it with your favorite video player! Dither effect showcasing swimming artifacts. A lot of the work Lucas Pope put into his dither effect was to counteract rotational dither swimming/artifacts. However, due to the nature of our game, we were only dealing with positional camera movement on the XY plane (with very minimal rotation, reserved for elements like camera shake). With the effect done in screen space, we found that the effect still made it difficult to distinguish details in the environment.\nYour browser doesn't support embedded videos, but don't worry, you can download it and watch it with your favorite video player! 1-bit dither effect. Using Screen-space. Looking back at some of my past projects, I realized we could circumvent the swimming altogether in this project by projecting the dither pattern to world space using Tri-planar mapping.\nThe Tri-planar mapping was not as straight forward to implement as I had initially thought due to the fact that we were attempting this on a fullscreen shader. Tri-planar mapping requires world-space position and normals to work, which we don\u0026rsquo;t have access to in a fullscreen shader pass. Luckily, in recent versions of URP (10.x+), we have access to ScriptableRenderPassInput.Normal in renderer features. This adds a DepthsNormals prepass which we can then sample in our dither shader like so:\n// At the top of the pass... #include \u0026#34;Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal/ShaderLibrary/DeclareNormalsTexture.hlsl\u0026#34; // For SampleSceneNormals() ... // In fragment shader... // \u0026#39;ScriptableRenderPassInput.Normal\u0026#39; gives us world-space normals, // so we don\u0026#39;t need to do any space converstions. float3 normalWS = SampleSceneNormals(UV); The other piece we need is the world-space position of our fragment, which we once again don\u0026rsquo;t have in a fullscreen shader. But, we can reconstruct it from the camera depth texture like so:\n// At the top of the pass... #include \u0026#34;Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal/ShaderLibrary/Core.hlsl\u0026#34; // For ComputeWorldSpacePosition() #include \u0026#34;Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal/ShaderLibrary/DeclareDepthTexture.hlsl\u0026#34; // For SampleSceneDepth() ... // In fragment shader... float2 UV = input.positionHCS.xy / _ScaledScreenParams.xy; // Sample the depth from the Camera depth texture. real depth = SampleSceneDepth(UV); float3 worldPos = ComputeWorldSpacePosition(UV, depth, UNITY_MATRIX_I_VP); With both these values, we can now perform tri-planar mapping like normal (pun intended) . In the end, we end up with the effect below:\nYour browser doesn't support embedded videos, but don't worry, you can download it and watch it with your favorite video player! 1-bit dither effect. Using Tri-planar projection. While this effect worked great for our purposes, there are some issues as can be seen in the animations above:\nA moiré pattern appears throughout the effect, more visible on surfaces facing perpendicular to the camera. I suspect this might be an issue with mipmapping but will have to explore this idea further. Pixel aliasing due to the small (and sometimes half-) pixels. I mitigated both of these issues by using TAA to \u0026ldquo;soak\u0026rdquo; up the moiré patterns, pixel aliasing, and half-pixel problems. TAA also had the added benefit of adding a \u0026ldquo;graininess\u0026rdquo; to the image with how it plays with the dithering effect, which suits the game\u0026rsquo;s aesthetic. While not a silver bullet to the listed problems, I am overall very pleased with the final result:\nYour browser doesn't support embedded videos, but don't worry, you can download it and watch it with your favorite video player!

I was responsible for:\nPSO Caching for each update to ensure a first-time hitch-free experience for players. Implementing UI to effectively communicate PSO pre-compilation to the user. Profiling to identify performance hotspots/hitches within levels. Various gameplay bug and crash fixes. PSO # Before every update including content additions or changes, I was tasked with playing through the game to accumulate a PSO cache that could be shipped to players.\nAn automatic PSO caching map was created to help speed up the process of PSO caching by rendering every vfx, mesh material + mesh permutation in the asset database. But, there were still missed PSOs that needed to be collected by manually playing through the game. Additionally, later in development of the post-launch content, several graphical enhancements were made to the Quest 3 version the game, thereby requiring two separate PSO caches (one for Quest 2 \u0026amp; one for Quest 3).\nAs the game grew with subsequent updates, the number of PSO permutations that needed to be captured exploded in size. Therefore I was given the responsibility of guiding a small group to assist me in the manual PSO caching process. With this group plus the automatic PSO caching map, the game was able to achieve a smooth 90 fps with minimal hitching (using Application Space Warp).\nUI # Due to the large number of PSO permutations, the final PSO cache was fairly large. We were receiving reports from players of long initial load times after every update. My solution for this was to create a \u0026ldquo;Shader Compiling\u0026rdquo; screen which would communicate to the player the progress remaining on the PSO pre-compilation. Along with this, I temporarily boosted CPU clock speeds during this compilation period.\nProfiling # Another part of my responsibilities was to crawl through the game to find potential performance issues that could lead to motion sickness for the player. I did this mainly using Unreal Insights. Render Doc was not used as much due to the majority of the performance issues with the game residing in the CPU domain.\nCrash/Bug Fixes # When I had run out of graphics related tasks to do, I took the initiative and helped the gameplay team with bug fixes and crashes that were either already documented on our Jira space, or more obscure ones caught by our Sentry instance running on live builds.\n","date":"17 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/professional/ghostbusters-rise-of-the-ghost-lord/","section":"","summary":"Multiplayer Virtual Reality FPS in the Ghostbusters universe","title":"Ghostbusters: Rise of The Ghost Lord","type":"projects/professional"},{"content":" Overview # Apocaparty is a 2D strategy-lite and time management game inspired by the likes of Diner Dash made during Summer Slow Jams 2023: Narrative.\nYou play as Cthulhu, tasked with organizing and managing Azathoth's waking up party .

Each guest has a set of metrics (such as hunger and thirst) that continually tick down and can also be influenced by external events occurring in the game world (e.g. power outage).\nRequests can only be fulfilled by the player completing a set of actions. Instead of hardcoding these actions, I implemented a simple Action List. These action lists are integrated into the editor via a custom editor script, allowing for designers on the team to create new actions lists on the fly using predetermined building blocks.\nAction List for Drink Refills. UI # I created a UI system that allowed us to quickly spin-up UI views and link them together to create pause menus but was also used for the dialogue system\u0026rsquo;s UI to great success.

Views have hooks for when they are popped and pushed from the stack, allowing for functionality such as transition animations.\nEvent Scripting # This was a difficult part of the project. Once we made an MVP, we quickly realized that the mechanics were too convoluted and therefore people had trouble figuring out what to do. We tackled this by stripping out a lot of mechanics and simplifying the gameplay loop to make it easier to digest. Along with that, we also decided to create a tutorial for the game to help ease players in.\nI went back and forth with the game designers a lot to decide the best ways the convey information to the player without making the tutorial too hand-holdy, as was a worry the rest of the team had from their past game jams.\nAll the tutorial scripting was done using Unity\u0026rsquo;s timeline system \u0026amp; API.

With a background primarily rooted in Unity, it was very interesting to see how the two engines differed with regards to philosophies and opinions about workflow and development. One aspect that particularly stood out to me was Godot\u0026rsquo;s embrace of a web-inspired approach to UI, which significantly streamlined the UI development process compared to Unity\u0026rsquo;s immediate-mode GUI.\nWhile we appreciated GDScript for its Python-like syntax, we encountered limitations in its flexibility when attempting to create a mini filesystem for the project.
