### Hey there!

**I'm Emre, a Programmer that loves games and game making!**

This website serves as a portfolio showcasing my past and ongoing work, primarily focused on **Game Development**. However, I occasionally delve into other topics that pique my interest.

My journey in programming began at the age of 15 when I was motivated to create my own games. It was during this time that my Economics teacher recognized my passion and suggested I explore the school's Computer Science course. Funnily enough, during my final year, that same Economics teacher became my Computer Science instructor! {{< superSmall "(small world...the department was understaffed)" >}}

During my Computer Science studies, I developed a fascination with **low-level computing**, inspired by classic games like **Doom** and **Wolfenstein 3D**â€”games that pushed hardware to its limits.

My curiosity led me into the intricate realm of shaders, graphics rendering, and GPUs. Since then, I've primarily worked as a **Graphics Engineer**.

Throughout my journey, I've been involved in various **graphics rendering** projects, both within and outside of school, and I've applied this knowledge to games I've worked on during game jams and other ventures.
