### Hey there!

**I'm Emre, a Programmer that loves games and game making!**

This website is a collection of all my past and ongoing work. Work that is focused mainly on **Game Development** but sometimes venturing out into other topics that fancy me.

I started programming at the age of 15, with the main motivation being to make my own games. My Economics teacher at the time noticed my interest and recommended I try out the school's Computer Science course. So, during my final year of highschool, my Economics teacher also happened to be my Computer Science teacher! {{< superSmall "(small world...the department was understaffed)" >}}

During my Computer Science studies, I grew interested in **low-level computing** and was fascinated by old-school games such as **Doom** and **Wolfenstein 3D**, which tried to squeeze the most out of their hardware.

So, in my quest to explore how those older games were made, I delved into the world of shaders, graphics rendering, GPUs, and have ever since been working mainly as a **Graphics Engineer**.

Since then, I've worked on **graphics rendering** projects both in and outside of school, and applied that knowledge to games that I would work on in game jams or otherwise.

Low-level programming is good for the programmer's soul.
