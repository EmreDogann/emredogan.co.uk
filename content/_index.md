I'm a Game Developer that enjoys all facets of development,\
primarily focusing on **graphics engineering** and **games programming**.

I have experience working at the higher-level with VFX/Shader development to lower-level work with graphics APIs such as **OpenGL** & **Vulkan**.

I started off my game development journey in **Unity** and have since also used other engines such as **Godot** and more bespoke **C++** engines during the course of my university degree. Currently, I am working in **Unreal Engine**.
